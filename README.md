# CS50W Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

First Project, James Cage JamesDCage@Gmail.com

## Background

My mom passed away in November 2019. She was a poet, and I am building a website to make her poems available to the world. I intend to update this site throughout CS50W, adding features as new technologies are covered in the class.

For example, instead of having each poem in a separate HTML file, I would like to store the poems in a database and create the HTML on the fly, using Flask and Python.

## Files

index.html: Home page. Demonstrates use of @media and flexbox in HTML, and embedded image.

bio.html: Biography of Joanne Cage

contents.html: List of poems with links. Currently only links to one poem, as intent is to use SQL, Flask, and Python to dynamically create index. Shows use of HTML table.

poem.html: "Singing in the Wilderness" by Joanne Ramey Cage. For demonstration purposes and formatting. Navbar left out intentionally, to allow reader to focus on poetry.

revision.html: Revision history. Added to allow demonstration of Bootstrap grid and HTML unordered list.

lotd.scss & lotd.css: SASS file, compiled to CSS.
