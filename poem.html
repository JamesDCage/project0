<h1>Singing in the Wilderness</h1>
<h2>by Joanne Ramey Cage</h2>

For a year I sang in the choir<br>
at Church of the Ascension,<br>
until the director discovered<br>
I was only moving my mouth<br>
and never making a sound.<br>
<br>
I had to be in the middle of the singing,<br>
though I'd never been able to read the notes<br>
or carry a tune in a bucket.<br>
So I may not sing in the choir<br>
when I enter the pearly gates;<br>
<br>
But if I can just be in the middle of the singing,<br>
my heart will sing like a mockingbird.<br>
